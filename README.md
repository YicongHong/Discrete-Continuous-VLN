"*What's it like to hold the hand of someone you love? Interlinked. Interlinked. Did they teach you how to feel finger to finger? Interlinked. Interlinked. Do you long for having your heart interlinked? Interlinked.*" --- [Blade Runner 2049 (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/).

<!-- "*Maybe it means something more - something we can't yet understand... I'm drawn across the universe to someone... Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it.*" --- [Interstellar (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/). -->
